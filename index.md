## welcome to aosune's little website!

i like to think of myself as an aspiring writer/visual novel developer focused on somehow expressing the inner turmoil one often keeps bottled up for lack of what to do with it.

i post my weird and bizarre ramblings about things as @blueapology on twitter. things may be a little bit melancholy but, as they say 'c'est la vie.'
