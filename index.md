## welcome to aosune's little website!

i like to think of myself as an aspiring writer/visual novel developer, despite my complete lack of coding experience and bad habit in overthinking tropes and the like.

i like to post my weird and bizarre ramblings about other media as @aosune on twitter and @sulkyblue on tumblr but if i make any progress on a personal project, my other blog and itch.io will be the first places to know (aside from here on github ha ha).

anyhoo, that's all from me for now!
